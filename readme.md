DF Map Processing
=================

A personal project to mess around with processing DF's exported maps into
interesting forms.

I'm currently focussed on improving the usability of the Fantasy Map Maker
and the Satellite Map Maker - both use GIMP in a very similar way.  I'll
first try to make the experience easier, then understand what the script is
doing and try to re-implement in Python with PIL, for eventual integration in
the PyLNP.
